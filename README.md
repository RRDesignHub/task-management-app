# Task Management Application

A Task Management Application that allows users to manage tasks through a drag-and-drop interface. The app supports task creation, editing, deletion, and reordering while offering real-time synchronization with a MongoDB backend. It also features authentication with Firebase and is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile users.

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Only authenticated users can access the app using Firebase Authentication (Google sign-in).
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks across categories:
  - To-Do
  - In Progress
  - Done
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Tasks can be dragged and dropped between categories or reordered within the same category.
- **Real-time Sync**: Changes are saved instantly to MongoDB and reflected in real-time on the frontend.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean, minimalistic UI that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: 
  - React.js
  - Vite.js
  - TailwindCSS
  - DaisyUI
  - Firebase Authentication
  - @dnd-kit (for drag-and-drop functionality)
  - React Query (for data fetching)
  - Axios (for API requests)
  - SweetAlert2 (for user notifications)
  - Date-fns (for date manipulation)

- **Backend**: 
  - Express.js
  - MongoDB (for task persistence)
  - JWT (for secure authentication)
  - CORS (to handle cross-origin requests)
  - morgan (for HTTP request logging)
